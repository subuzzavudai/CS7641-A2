# CS7641-A2

Install the requirements mentioned in the requirement.txt present in the Randomized Optimization folder.

# Neural Networks

For the Neural Networks part of the assignment, the files are in the Neural Network folder. Place the training and testing data in a folder named as 'data' and this data folder should be in the same folder as the algorithm files. Install jython and make sure the ABAGAIL.jar is in the same folder as the files. Run the files with the command - jython <filename.py>

The backpropagation neural network is implemented in a separate ipynb file which can be loaded into a jupyter notebook.

# Randomized Optimization

For the Randomized optimzation part of the assignment, the files are in the Randomized Optimization folder. Install Jython and also make sure the ABAGAIL.jar is the same folder as the files. Run the files with the command - jython <filename.py>

Output csv and graphs are saved to ./output and ./output/images respectively. There are sub-folders for each of the problems(FLIPFLOP, TSP, CONTINUOSPEAKS) 
The module will create the folder even if they do not exist.

The plotting script takes care of the grapg generation.
